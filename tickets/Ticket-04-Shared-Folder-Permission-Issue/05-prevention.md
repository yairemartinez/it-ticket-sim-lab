# Prevention – Preventing Permission Issues

## Prevention Steps
- Used group-based permissions instead of assigning access directly to users.
- Reviewed both share and NTFS permissions when configuring access.

## Operational Notes
- Effective access is determined by the most restrictive permission.
- NTFS permissions should be the primary access control mechanism.

## Escalation Criteria
- Access issues affecting multiple users
- Unclear or undocumented permission requirements
