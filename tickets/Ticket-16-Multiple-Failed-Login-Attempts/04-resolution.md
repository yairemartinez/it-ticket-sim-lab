# Resolution – Addressing Failed Login Attempts

## Resolution Steps
1. Reviewed security logs to identify the source of the lockout.
2. Confirmed the lockout was caused by repeated incorrect password attempts.
3. Contacted the user (simulated) to confirm credential confusion.
4. Unlocked the user account in Active Directory Users and Computers.
5. Verified successful login using correct credentials.
