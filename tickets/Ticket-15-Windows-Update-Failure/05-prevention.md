# Prevention – Preventing Windows Update Failures

## Prevention Steps
- Ensure update-related services remain enabled and running.
- Monitor systems for update failures or prolonged update checks.
- Address update issues early to prevent missed security updates.

## Operational Notes
- Stopped or unstable services are a common cause of Windows Update failures.
- Windows Update may automatically attempt to restart required services.
- Reboots can be required to fully restore Settings and service dependencies.

## Escalation Criteria
Escalate to systems administration if:
- Update failures persist after service verification.
- Multiple systems exhibit similar update issues.
- Updates fail across multiple update cycles or affect security patches.
