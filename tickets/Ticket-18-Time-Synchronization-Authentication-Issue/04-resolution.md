# Resolution – Time Synchronization Verification

## Resolution Steps
1. Verified domain time synchronization policies were enforced.
2. Confirmed the client system was correctly syncing time with the domain controller.
3. Reviewed Kerberos ticket status to ensure authentication was functioning normally.
4. Determined no remediation was required.
