- Document correct DNS settings for static IP configurations.


## Operational Notes
- Public DNS servers cannot resolve internal Active Directory records.
- DNS misconfiguration can mimic broader network failures.


## Escalation Criteria
- DNS failures affecting multiple clients
- Suspected DNS service outages
