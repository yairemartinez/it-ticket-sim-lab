# Prevention – Preventing Disk Space Issues

## Prevention Steps
- Encourage regular review of disk usage via Windows Storage settings.
- Advise users to avoid storing large files on the system drive.
- Recommend periodic cleanup of temporary files and Recycle Bin contents.

## Operational Notes
- Low disk space can negatively impact system performance, updates, and application stability.
- Windows Storage provides effective built-in visibility for most disk usage scenarios.
- If disk usage is difficult to locate using native tools, third-party utilities such as **WizTree** can be used to quickly identify large files and directories.

## Security Awareness
- Large or unknown files should be treated cautiously.
- Suspicious files should be analyzed or escalated rather than deleted blindly.

## Escalation Criteria
Escalate to systems administration if:
- Disk space alerts recur frequently.
- Storage cannot be reclaimed safely.
- The system drive is undersized for operational requirements.
