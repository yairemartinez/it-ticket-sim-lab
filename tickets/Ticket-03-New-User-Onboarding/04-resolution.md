# Prevention – Standardized Onboarding Process

## Prevention Steps
- Used group-based access instead of direct permissions.
- Applied consistent OU placement for new users.
- Enforced password change at first login.

## Operational Notes
- Onboarding should follow a documented checklist.
- Group membership should reflect job role, not individual access.

## Escalation Criteria
- Missing access after onboarding
- Incorrect OU or group assignment
