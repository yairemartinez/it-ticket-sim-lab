# Prevention – Reducing Repeat Lockouts

## Prevention Steps
- Identified the source workstation responsible for the lockout using Event ID 4740.
- Documented the process for correlating account lockouts to originating devices.
- Advised that users should update any saved or cached credentials after password changes.

## Operational Notes
- If lockouts recur from the same device, stored credentials, scheduled tasks, or background services should be reviewed.
- If lockouts originate from unknown systems, escalation is recommended.

## Escalation Criteria
- Repeated lockouts after corrective action
- Lockouts originating from multiple or unexpected systems
- Suspected credential misuse
