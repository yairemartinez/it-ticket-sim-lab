# Prevention – Preventing Data Loss

## Prevention Steps
- Reinforced the importance of maintaining backups for shared resources.
- Encouraged careful handling of files in shared folders.

## Operational Notes
- Accidental deletions are common in shared environments.
- Having a known backup location significantly reduces recovery time.
- If files are difficult to locate or unusually large, disk analysis tools (e.g., WinDirStat or WizTree) may assist in identifying storage usage safely.

## Security Awareness
- Unexpected or suspicious files should be reviewed carefully before deletion.
- If a file appears abnormal, it should be analyzed in a controlled manner rather than immediately removed.

## Escalation Criteria
- Missing or outdated backups
- Data loss affecting multiple users
- Repeated accidental deletions
